# ComputerNetwork-assignment-Stimulation-of-Network-Communication
In this project, I stimulate network communication based on stop-and-wait protocal and GBN protocal using socket to stimulate transmission.

Stop-and-wait protocal has receiver and sender.

GBN protocal has only client which both has the function of sending and receiving message.

Both two protocals involve CRC verification.
